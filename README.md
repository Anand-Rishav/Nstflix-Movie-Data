# Netflix Movie Data Analysis and Clustering

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and K-means clustering of a movie dataset. It explores data characteristics, relationships, and patterns through visualizations and statistical analysis.

## Contents

- `Movie_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and clustering code.
- `data.csv`: The movie dataset used for analysis (replace with your actual data file).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Open the `Movie_Data_Analysis.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the analysis and generate visualizations.

## Analysis Steps

The notebook covers the following steps:

- **Data Loading and Cleaning:** Loads the movie dataset, handles missing values, and prepares it for analysis.
- **Data Exploration:** Examines data types, distributions, and potential outliers for numerical and categorical features.
- **Data Visualization:** Creates histograms, box plots, bar charts, and scatter plots to visualize data characteristics and relationships.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Calculates and visualizes the correlation between numerical features.
- **Categorical Feature Analysis:** Analyzes the frequency and impact of categorical features like movie type and genres.
- **K-means Clustering:** Applies K-means clustering to group movies based on selected features.
- **Summary and Insights:** Provides a summary of key findings and potential next steps for further analysis.

## Dependencies

The notebook requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install them using pip:
